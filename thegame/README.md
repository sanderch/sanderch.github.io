# Mini RTS Game

This project is a browser-based real-time strategy (RTS) game prototype. It features:

- Grid-based map with buildings and peasant units
- Unit selection (single and drag-select)
- Right-click movement with A* pathfinding
- Animated sprites and obstacle avoidance

## Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `js/` – JavaScript source code
- `img/` – Image assets

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Future Extensions
- Modularize code (split into multiple JS files)
- Add more unit/building types
- Implement resources, combat, and UI improvements
