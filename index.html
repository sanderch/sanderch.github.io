    <marquee behavior="alternate">The marquee element creates scrolling text that is difficult to read and click on. Beyond that, it can be distracting to viewers, especially to those with low vision, cognitive disabilities, or attention deficits. People with attention deficits or cognitive disabilities could become distracted by content that scrolls. Stop reading this, get your shit together and go back to work!</marquee>
